# VoyAI - A Sirvoy-Inspired Property Management System (MVP)

VoyAI is a functional, cloud-based Property Management System (PMS) inspired by Sirvoy. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was generated by an AI assistant to demonstrate how modern AI can rapidly prototype and build complex, full-stack applications, highlighting the potential for accelerated competition in the SaaS space.

The system is designed for small to medium-sized hospitality businesses (B&Bs, multi-STRs, small hotels) and focuses on core management features, channel synchronization, and innovative AI-driven enhancements.

## Core Concept

This project serves as a proof-of-concept to:
1.  **Prove Technical Feasibility:** Show that a functional PMS alternative can be generated with minimal human coding.
2.  **Demonstrate Competitive Risk:** Illustrate how AI-driven development can drastically reduce time-to-market, posing a strategic risk to established players.
3.  **Provide a Solid Foundation:** The generated code is not just a demo; it's a well-architected starting point for a real-world application.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **Frontend:** React.js (using Vite), Material-UI
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
-   **Key Libraries:** `pg` for database connection, `bcrypt` for password hashing, `axios` for API calls, `node-cron` for scheduled tasks.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality (Sirvoy-Inspired)
-   **Multi-Property Management:** Admins can create and manage multiple properties.
-   **Room Management:** Add, view, and manage rooms with details like capacity, rates, and amenities for each property.
-   **Reservation Management:** A central system to view all bookings, whether from direct channels or OTAs.
-   **Booking Engine:** A guest-facing page (`/book`) to search for and book rooms directly.
-   **Channel Synchronization (Simulated):** A background job runs every 5 minutes to simulate fetching new bookings from Booking.com and Airbnb and logging the activity. This can be switched to real API calls.

### Innovative AI Enhancements
-   **Smart Pricing:** An API endpoint (`/api/ai/smart-pricing/:roomId`) that suggests dynamic rate adjustments based on simulated occupancy and demand.
-   **Automated Guest Communications:** An endpoint to generate personalized welcome and reminder messages using templates and randomized phrasing to feel more natural.
-   **Automated Housekeeping:** When a new reservation is created, a housekeeping task is automatically generated and scheduled for the checkout date.

## Local Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install Node.js (v18+) and PostgreSQL.
2.  **Database:**
    -   Start PostgreSQL and open the `psql` shell.
    -   Create the database: `CREATE DATABASE voyai;`
    -   Connect to it: `\\c voyai`
    -   Run the contents of `database.sql` to create the tables.
3.  **Backend:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    -   Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and fill in your `DATABASE_URL` and a `JWT_SECRET`.
    -   Run `npm install`.
    -   Run `npm start`. The server will be live on `http://localhost:5000`.
4.  **Frontend:**
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    -   Run `npm install`.
    -   Run `npm run dev`. The app will be live on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can register a new admin account and start using the dashboard.
