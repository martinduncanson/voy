# VoyAI (MVP) &nbsp;– A Sirvoy-Inspired, AI-Bootstrapped PMS

> **TL;DR**  
> VoyAI is a fully-functioning, cloud-native PMS prototype that proves how modern AI-assisted development can compress *months* of work into a few hours. It couples a **Node + Express + Prisma** service layer with a **Vite/React** UI, packaged for friction-free deployment via **Docker Compose** or a traditional **NGINX → PM2 stack**.

---

## 1  Core Concept

The primary goal of VoyAI is to provide an all-in-one solution for small to medium-sized hospitality businesses (e.g., boutique hotels, B&Bs, vacation rentals). The system is designed to streamline operations, from booking and reservation management to housekeeping and guest communication, with a forward-thinking approach that includes AI-powered enhancements.

This MVP is built to be:
* **Functional:** A working demo with core PMS features.
* **Scalable:** An architecture that can grow with business needs.
* **Modern:** Leveraging best practices in web development for performance and maintainability.

* **AI-aided extensions** – dynamic pricing, auto-comms, housekeeping scheduling.
* **Dev-velocity showcase** – the entire MVP (code you are reading) was scaffolded by an AI assistant to illustrate how quickly a serious competitor could materialise.

---

## 2  Why This Tech Stack?

The technologies for VoyAI were chosen to maximize developer productivity, ensure type safety, and deliver high performance.

### ### Backend: Node.js, Express.js & Prisma

* **Node.js & Express.js:** Node.js's asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model is a perfect fit for a PMS. It can efficiently handle thousands of concurrent connections from users, booking channels, and API requests without getting bogged down. This is crucial for real-time features like calendar updates and channel synchronization. Express.js provides a minimalist and flexible framework for building the robust REST API that powers the application.

* **Prisma (ORM):** Prisma is a next-generation ORM that revolutionizes database interactions.
    * **Type Safety:** It auto-generates a type-safe client from your `schema.prisma` file. This means your database queries are validated at compile time, catching errors before they ever reach production.
    * **Simplified Queries:** Its intuitive API makes complex queries (like joins and transactions) simple and readable, significantly reducing boilerplate code.
    * **Migration Management:** `prisma migrate` provides a powerful, declarative system for evolving your database schema safely and keeping it in sync with your models. This is a massive improvement over manually writing and managing SQL migration scripts.

### ### Frontend: React (with Vite) & Material-UI

* **React:** Its component-based architecture allows for the creation of a complex, reusable, and easily maintainable user interface.
* **Vite:** Provides a lightning-fast development experience with near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build tooling.
* **React Query:** Simplifies data fetching, caching, and state synchronization, eliminating the need for complex global state management for server-side data.
* **Material-UI (MUI):** A comprehensive library of UI components that allows for rapid development of a professional and visually appealing dashboard.

## Architectural Advantages Over PHP

While PHP is a capable language, this Node.js/React architecture offers several distinct advantages over a traditional monolithic PHP application (e.g., a LAMP stack):

* **Decoupled (Headless) Architecture:** The backend is a standalone REST API. The React frontend is just one client that consumes it. This separation of concerns means you can easily build other clients (like a native mobile app for iOS/Android) on top of the same API without rewriting any backend logic.

* **Superior Real-Time Capabilities:** Node.js, combined with **Socket.IO**, is built for real-time communication. Features like instant notifications for new bookings or live chat with guests are far more complex to implement efficiently in a traditional PHP environment.

* **Full-Stack Type Safety:** With TypeScript or JSDoc in the backend and TypeScript/PropTypes in the frontend, combined with Prisma's type-safe client, you can achieve end-to-end type safety. This drastically reduces runtime errors and makes the codebase more robust and refactor-friendly.

* **Scalability and Performance:** The event-driven, non-blocking nature of Node.js is designed for I/O-heavy applications like a PMS, which constantly queries the database and external services. This can lead to better performance and resource utilization under heavy load compared to PHP's synchronous request/response model.

## Ultra-lightweight Hardware Requirements

On a single 8-core / 32 GB VPS you can safely serve ≈ 70 k – 135 k concurrent guests, depending on how chatty the front-end is, while keeping p99 API latency < 150 ms.

* **Back-of-envelope capacity translation:** We need to map “req/s” → “concurrent guests”. For a typical booking widget:
Live page pings availability every 10 s → 0.1 req/s/user (heavy, DB-hit).
UI also holds a WebSocket but that is idle CPU-wise.

* 13 500 req/s ÷ 0.1 req/s/user  ≈ 135 000 simultaneous guest users. Add maybe 1 000 staff dashboards (heavier, ~1 req/s) and you are still under 80 % CPU.

* If you instead poll every 5 s (0.2 req/s/user) the same box sustains ≈ 67 500 guests.

## Why this holds together

Node throughput numbers: 
* Public benchmarks place an Express + Postgres hit at 2 400 – 2 800 req/s per vCPU on c6g instances. 
* We used the conservative 2 600 figure and still shaved 35 % off for head-room.

## Memory footprint

**PostgreSQL:** https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/analyze-your-postgresql-memory/ measures 1.5–14 MB per backend; we pool 80 connections (10 per worker) ⇒ ≤ 1 GB. Shared buffers at 25 % RAM (8 GB) gives excellent hit ratios for a dataset of ±10 M reservations. 
**Node workers:** 8 × (60 MB idle + 80 MB live heap) ≈ 1 GB. 
**WebSocket objects:** ≈ 2 KB each ⇒ 200 k users ≈ 400 MB JS side + ~800 MB kernel. 

## Single-box trade-offs

Pros: zero network hops, simplest ops.
Cons: you share CPU cache between Postgres and Node. Under Black-Friday-style spikes, DB checkpoints can jitter API latency. Vertical scaling up to 16 cores is painless, but beyond that, read-replica or pgBouncer split becomes cheaper.

## Why these numbers are credible
CPU evidence – An Express process with DB writes managed ≈ 2 600 req/s on a single-core t2.small in public testing; a pure in-memory route cleared ≈ 7 300 req/s.
Memory per Postgres connection – AWS engineers measured 1.5–14.5 MB real-world overhead per backend
Socket overhead – Node keeps per-socket state in JS objects; typical resident footprint is ≈ 2 KB (buffers + handle metadata) – tiny compared with V8 heap.


### Head-room & scaling out

Horizontal Node scaling – Because Prisma uses a connection pool per process, simply adding more API instances (or Kubernetes pods) scales CPU without exploding DB connections—just cap each pool at 10–12.

* **pgBouncer** – If you ever need <200 ms query spikes for BI dashboards, stick pgBouncer in transaction mode; Postgres now holds ~1 GB RAM no matter how many Node workers you add.

* **Read replicas** – 25 k properties × multi-year reservations history can outgrow SSD cache. A single async replica offloads reports with no write penalty.

* **Beyond 50 k guests** – Tests show Express is CPU-bound long before it’s memory-bound, so the upgrade path is linear: +1 core ≈ +2 500 req/s.

With this sizing in place you can confidently add features without immediately racing for bigger metal—and that’s the real strength of the Node + Prisma stack.

| Layer | Stack | Why it beats the obvious PHP/LAMP alternative |
|-------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Runtime** | **Node 20 + Express 4** | Single-threaded, non-blocking I/O is ideal for channel-sync polling, WebSockets, and heavy JSON workloads. A PHP FPM process would block per request without ReactPHP-style hacks. |
| **ORM/Data** | **Prisma 5** | *Type-safe* queries, migrations-as-code, and a fluent API. Prisma shields you from SQL-string injection bugs and makes refactors painless—something PDO in PHP simply can’t match. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL 14** | ACID compliance, native JSONB columns (great for OTA payloads), and powerful upserts. |
| **Real-time** | **Socket.io 4** | Drop-in push updates (e.g., channel-sync events) without polling tricks. With PHP you’d need Ratchet or RoadRunner externally. |
| **Background jobs** | **Node-Cron** | Share code with the HTTP layer. In PHP you’d run separate cron + CLI scripts, duplicating business logic. |
| **Auth** | **JWT (stateless)** | Easily shared between Node API and React SPA; no server-side session storage. |
| **Front-end** | **React 18 + Vite 5 + MUI 5** | Instant HMR, modern JSX, typed hooks; effortlessly consumes the JSON API. Classic PHP templating can’t match the developer UX or component reuse. |
| **Tests** | **Jest + Supertest (API)**, **Cypress 12 (E2E)** | End-to-end confidence with minimal boilerplate. |
| **Packaging** | **Docker (multi-service Compose)** | One-command parity between local dev, CI runners, and prod VPS; eradicate “works on my machine”. |

### Additional Strengths over a Typical PHP Monolith

* **Isomorphic code reuse** – validation helpers and DTOs can be shared across server & client.
* **Native ES Modules** – clean `import` syntax throughout the repo.
* **First-class package manager** – >2 million NPM modules vs disparate PHP Composer repos.
* **Better concurrency model** – Node’s event loop + clustering scales horizontally without PHP-FPM pool juggling.
* **Simpler DevOps** – A single `Dockerfile` builds both API & UI; a `docker-compose up -d` spins the full stack.
